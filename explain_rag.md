## Why RAG? 
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is used to improve the relevance and quality of interview questions.

## Contextual Questioning: 
RAG helps generate specific questions based on the candidate's resume, such as asking about challenges faced in a particular project instead of general questions.

## Targeted Questioning: 
By retrieving relevant information from the resume or job description, RAG tailors questions to the candidateâ€™s skills, experience, and projects.

## Better Insights: 
This results in deeper, more meaningful interviews by focusing on the candidate's actual expertise and experiences.


# Example(from resume):
"Developed a recommendation system using collaborative filtering to suggest products to users based on their previous purchases."

## Without RAG:
Question 1: "What programming languages are you comfortable with?"
Question 2: "How do you approach software development?"

## With RAG:
Question 1: "What method did you use for similarity measurement in your collaborative filtering model?"
Question 2: "How did you handle cold-start problems in your recommendation system?"
Question 3: "Can you explain how you evaluated the performance of your recommendation system?"
